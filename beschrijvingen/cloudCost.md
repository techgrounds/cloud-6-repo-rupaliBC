### Capex: A capital expenditure is incurred when a business spends money, uses collateral, or takes on debt to either buy a new asset or add to the value of an existing asset with the expectation of receiving benefits for longer than a single tax year. 
### Opex: An operating expense (OPEX) is an expense required for the day-to-day functioning of a business.
### Pay_as_you_go: Pay as You Go is a pricing principle that lets you rent resources on-demand. This model provides complete flexibility over how many machines you run and for how long. You can leverage on-demand resources when you cannot buy or build your own infrastructure
### Save_when_you_reserve : AWS provides significant discounts, ranging between 30% and 72%, on reserved EC2 instances. This option lets you reserve compute capacity for a long period of time (1 or 3 years).
### Pay_less_when_using_more : With AWS, you can get volume based discounts and realize important savings as your usage increases. For services such as S3, pricing is tiered, meaning the more you use, the less you pay per GB.
### Pay_less_as_AWS_grows : The optimizations and growing economies of scale of AWS result in savings in the form of lower pricing. Since 2006, AWS has consistently lowered prices (45 price drops as of Aug 1,2014).
