# Elastic Beanstalk
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications. Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.
## Key-terms
- Application version : 
In Elastic Beanstalk, an application version refers to a specific, labeled iteration of deployable code for a web application. An application version points to an Amazon Simple Storage Service 
In a running environment, you can deploy any application version you already uploaded to the application, or you can upload and immediately deploy a new application version. 
- Environment : 
An environment is a collection of AWS resources running an application version. Each environment runs only one application version at a time, however, you can run the same application version or different application versions in many environments simultaneously
- Environment tier : 
When you launch an Elastic Beanstalk environment, you first choose an environment tier. The environment tier designates the type of application that the environment runs, and determines what resources Elastic Beanstalk provisions to support it. An application that serves HTTP requests runs in a web server environment tier. A backend environment that pulls tasks from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue runs in a worker environment tier.
- Environment configuration: 
An environment configuration identifies a collection of parameters and settings that define how an environment and its associated resources behave. When you update an environmentâ€™s configuration settings, Elastic Beanstalk automatically applies the changes to existing resources or deletes and deploys new resources (depending on the type of change).
