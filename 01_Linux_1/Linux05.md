# [Linux- User and Usergrous]
[Linux has users, similar to accounts on Windows and MacOS. Every user has their own home directory. Users can also be part of groups.
There is a special user called ‘root’. Root is allowed to do anything.
To gain temporary root permissions, you can type ‘sudo’ in front of a command, but that only works if you’re allowed to do that.]

## Key-terms
1. Sudo: sudo is a command which grants superuser privileges to non root users.
2. usermod -a -G sudo USERNAME
3. Usermod: calls the program

    -a: to add to a group
    
    -G: to specify the group


## Opdracht


-  Create a new user in your VM. 
-  The new user should be part of an admin group that also contains the user you created during installation.
-  The new user should have a password.
-  The new user should be able to use ‘sudo’
-  Locate the files that store users, passwords, and groups. See if you can find your newly created user’s data in there.
