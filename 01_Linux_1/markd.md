# Instagram
## Instagram is a free, online photo-sharing application and social network platform that was acquired by Facebook in 2012. Instagram allows users to edit and upload photos and short videos through a mobile app. ... Users also have the option of making their profile private so that only their followers can view their posts.
### Photographic filters
Instagram offers a number of photographic filters that users can apply to their images. In February 2012, Instagram added a "Lux" filter, an effect that "lightens shadows, darkens highlights and increases contrast".[158][159] In December 2014, Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Aden, and Perpetua were five new filters to be added to the Instagram filter family.[160]

### Video
Initially a purely photo-sharing service, Instagram incorporated 15-second video sharing in June 2013.[161][162] The addition was seen by some in the technology media as Facebook's attempt at competing with the then-popular video-sharing application Vine.[163][164] In August 2015, Instagram added support for widescreen videos.[165][166] In March 2016, Instagram increased the 15-second video limit to 60 seconds.[167][168] Albums were introduced in February 2017, which allow up to 10 minutes of video to be shared in one post.[133][134][169]
