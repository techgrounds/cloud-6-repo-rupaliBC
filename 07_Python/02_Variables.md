# Variables
A variable can store a value. This value can then be accessed with the variable name in the code. This is useful if you want to use one value multiple times, or if you want to dynamically change the value.

A variable name can be any string of characters (except for some special cases that are reserved for other use). It is a best practice to use variable names that are short, but also clear. For example, a variable that stores user input might be named input or usr_inpt.
