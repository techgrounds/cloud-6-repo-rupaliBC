# Setting Up
When installing Python, make sure to add Python to your PATH variable (even if you’re on Windows).

In order to start writing code, you’ll need an IDE. The most popular IDE is Visual Studio Code (VS Code), because it is free, lightweight, easy to use, and there are a lot of plug-ins available for high customizability.
