# Identity and Access Management
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.
## Key-terms
- Principal
A principal is a person or application that can make a request for an action or operation on an AWS resource. The principal is authenticated as the AWS account root user or an IAM entity to make requests to AWS

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) : 
You can add two-factor authentication to your account and to individual users for extra security. With MFA you or your users must provide not only a password or access key to work with your account, but also a code from a specially configured device.

- Identity-based policies – Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that control what actions an identity (users, groups of users, and roles) can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. 

- Resource-based policies – Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource such as an Amazon S3 bucket. These policies grant the specified principal permission to perform specific actions on that resource and defines under what conditions this applies. Resource-based policies are inline policies. There are no managed resource-based policies.

## Opdracht
- Create a s3 bucket for a company where each user with Multi-Factor authetication can Read and Write data. 
- Create two users one with Multi-Factor authetication (MFA) and one without MFA
- Provide a policy where users only with MFA are allowed to read / write an object in s3 bucket.

### Ervaren problemen

### Resultaat
### - Create a bucket.

### - Policy applied to the bucket :
 ``` {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "123",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mfabucket11/taxdocuments/*",
            "Condition": {
                "Null": {
                    "aws:MultiFactorAuthAge": "true"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mfabucket11/*"
        }
    ]
} 
 ```

### - 2 Users created one with assigned MFA device

### - Barcode to assgin MFA to one of the user:

### - MFA assigned to the user:

### - While signing in as a MFA User , needed to enter MFA code

### - A User only with assigned MFA could write in the s3 bucket . This is because we have json policy which says only MFA users are allowed to access the bucket for write/read opertions.
