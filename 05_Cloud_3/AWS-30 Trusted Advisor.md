# Trusted Advisor
Trusted Advisor draws upon best practices learned from serving hundreds of thousands of AWS customers. Trusted Advisor inspects your AWS environment, and then makes recommendations when opportunities exist to save money, improve system availability and performance, or help close security gaps.
If you have a Basic or Developer Support plan, you can use the Trusted Advisor console to access all checks in the Service Limits category and six checks in the Security category.

If you have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, you can use the Trusted Advisor console and the AWS Support API to access all Trusted Advisor checks. You also can use Amazon CloudWatch Events to monitor the status of Trusted Advisor checks.

You can view the check descriptions and results for the following check categories:

Cost optimization – Recommendations that can potentially save you money. These checks highlight unused resources and opportunities to reduce your bill.

Performance – Recommendations that can improve the speed and responsiveness of your applications.

Security – Recommendations for security settings that can make your AWS solution more secure.

Fault tolerance – Recommendations that help increase the resiliency of your AWS solution. These checks highlight redundancy shortfalls, current service limits (also known as quotas), and overused resources.

Service limits – Checks the usage for your account and whether your account approaches or exceeds the limit (also known as quotas) for AWS services and resources.
